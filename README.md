# Genetic-Algorithm
A string finder genetic algorithm implemented in python. Technique learned by the code bullet on YouTube. 

Currently is not very quick, but looking to optimize implementation in the future so that it can deduce larger strings in less time. 

The first time I have tried to do anything with Machine Learning or AI.
